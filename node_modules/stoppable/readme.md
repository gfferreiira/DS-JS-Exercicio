# Stoppable

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hunterloftis/stoppable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hunterloftis/stoppable)

> Node's `server.close()` the way you probably [expected it to work by default](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2642).

## Summary

```js
const server = stoppable(http.createServer(handler))
server.stop()
```

Stoppable stops accepting new connections and closes existing, idle connections (including keep-alives)
without killing requests that are in-flight.

## Requirements

- Node.js v6+

Node.js v4.x is *unofficially* supported.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add stoppable
```

(or use npm)

## Usage

**constructor**

```js
stoppable(server, grace)
```

Decorates the server instance with a `stop` method.
Returns the server instance, so can be chained, or can be run as a standalone statement.

- server: Any HTTP or HTTPS Server instance
- grace: Milliseconds to wait before force-closing connections

`grace` defaults to Infinity (don't force-close).
If you want to immediately kill all sockets you can use a grace of 0.

**stop()**

```js
server.stop(callback)
```

Closes the server.

- callback: passed along to the existing `server.close` function to auto-register a 'close' event.
The first agrument is an error, and the second argument is a boolean that indicates whether it stopped gracefully.

## Design decisions

- Monkey patching generally sucks, but in this case it's the nicest API. Let's call it "decorating."
- `grace` could be specified on `stop`, but it's better to match the existing `server.close` API.
- Clients should be handled respectfully, so we aren't just destroying sockets, we're sending `FIN` packets first.
- Any solution to this problem requires bookkeeping on every connection and request/response.
We're doing a minimum of work on these "hot" code paths and delaying as much as possible to the actual
